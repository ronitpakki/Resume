        Developed by McDonnell Douglas and later on by Boeing, the F-15 is still
        produced. But, Boeing is set to end the production of F-15 in 2022. Even
        though it was delivered more than 35 years ago, the F-15 is still
        considered a very capable fighter in the air. It still is operated by 4
        countries: Israel, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.

      <p>
        The HAL Tejas is an Indian fighter jet that is replacing the MiG-21,
        which the Indian Air Force has been using since 1964. Pilots praise the
        HAL Tejas for its high maneuverability. Production on the
        fourth-generation Indian jet fighter began recently, due to the fact
        that the program struggled to obtain an Operational Clearance.

      <li>Eurofighter Typhoon</li>

      <p>
        Out of all the fighter jets in the list, the story of the Typhoon is one
        of the most interesting ones. A joint operation of Airbus, BAE Systems
        and Leonardo, an Italian company developed the Typhoon. After
        development began in 1983, the first official test flight took off in
        1994. The Typhoon was plagued by delays. After the fall of the Berlin
        Wall and a change of government in Germany, the Chancellor of Germany at
        the time made a promise to cancel the project. However, the program
        survived and after a myriad of delays Germany deployed the first
        Eurofighter Typhoons.
